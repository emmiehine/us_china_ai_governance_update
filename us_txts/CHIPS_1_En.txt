                     Subtitle A--Preliminary Matters

SEC. 10301. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the National Science Foundation, the Department of 
        Energy and its National Laboratories, and other key Federal 
        agencies have carried out vital work supporting basic and 
        applied research to create knowledge that is a key driver of the 
        economy of the United States and a critical component of 
        national security;
            (2) openness to diverse perspectives and a focus on freedom 
        from censorship and political bias will continue to make 
        educational and research institutions in the United States 
        beacons to thousands of students from across the world;
            (3) increasing research and technology transfer investments, 
        building regional capacity and reducing geographic disparity, 
        strengthening supply chains, and increasing capabilities in key 
        technology focus areas will enhance the competitive advantage 
        and leadership of the United States in the global economy;
            (4) the Federal Government must utilize the full talent and 
        potential of the entire Nation by avoiding undue geographic 
        concentration of research and STEM education funding, 
        encouraging broader participation of populations 
        underrepresented in STEM, and collaborating with nongovernment

SEC. 10365. RECOGNITION OF THE ARECIBO OBSERVATORY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Department of Defense began developing the Arecibo 
        Observatory located in Barrio Esperanza, Arecibo, Puerto Rico, 
        during the 1950s, and its characteristic instrument, a large 
        radio telescope of 305 meters in diameter was completed in 1963.
            (2) The facility was later owned by the National Science 
        Foundation, and supported by the National Aeronautics and Space 
        Administration and various university partners.
            (3) The Arecibo Observatory's 305-meter fixed spherical 
        radio telescope, was the world's largest single-dish radio 
        telescope until the Five-Hundred-Meter Aperture Spherical Radio 
        Telescope located in Gizhou, China, began observing in 2016.
            (4) The 305-meter radio telescope made unparalleled 
        contributions to the fields of radio astronomy, planetary, and 
        atmospheric sciences, and played a role in inspiring thousands 
        of students in Puerto Rico, the Nation, and the world to pursue 
        careers in STEM fields through the Arecibo Observatory Education 
        and Public Outreach Programs.
            (5) The radio telescope significantly advanced the field of 
        radio astronomy, including the first indirect detection of 
        gravitational waves, the first detection of extrasolar planets, 
        innumerable contributions to the field of time domain astronomy 
        and the study of the interstellar medium, and played a key role 
        in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
            (6) The Arecibo Observatory had the best planetary radar 
        system in the world, used by the National Aeronautics and Space 
        Administration for near-Earth object detection and was an 
        essential part of the agency's planetary defense program.

[[Page 136 STAT. 1570]]

            (7) The planetary radar at the Arecibo Observatory has 
        contributed fundamentally and significantly to the knowledge of 
        the solar system.
            (8) The Arecibo Observatory's Incoherent Scatter Radar and 
        supporting facilities have provided fundamental understanding of 
        the ionosphere and upper atmosphere, and the interface between 
        the atmosphere and space that protects the planet from solar 
        wind, meteors, and other potential threats.
            (9) December 1, 2021, marks the 1-year anniversary of the 
        uncontrolled collapse sustained by the radio telescope after a 
        series of cable failures in tower 4.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Congress--
            (1) acknowledges the loss of the Arecibo Observatory's radio 
        telescope due to its collapse and its implications for the loss 
        of a unique world-class multidisciplinary science facility which 
        conducted research in the areas of space and atmospheric 
        sciences, radar astronomy and planetary sciences, astronomy, and 
        astrophysics;
            (2) acknowledges that the uncontrolled collapse of the 305-
        meter radio telescope represents a loss of astronomical 
        observation capabilities, scientific research and development, 
        planetary defense capabilities, and applied science capabilities 
        for the United States;
            (3) recognizes the rich scientific, educational, and 
        economic benefits that the Arecibo Telescope has made to the 
        people of Puerto Rico, the Nation, and the world;
            (4) recognizes the work and contributions made by the 
        thousands of dedicated staff who have supported the Arecibo 
        Observatory for close to 6 decades;
            (5) commends the National Science Foundation for convening a 
        virtual workshop in June 2021, to explore ideas for future 
        scientific and educational activities at the Arecibo 
        Observatory; and
            (6) encourages the National Science Foundation, in 
        consultation with other Federal agencies, to explore 
        opportunities for strengthening and expanding the role of the 
        Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico through education, outreach, 
        and diversity programs, and future research capabilities and 
        technology at the site.

                Doctor of Philosophy in the science, technology, 
                engineering, and mathematics fields is estimated to cost 
                approximately $500,000; and
                    (F) attrition of an individual so trained results in 
                a loss of talent and money.

[[Page 136 STAT. 1628]]

            (2) According to a 2017 University of Illinois study, among 
        astronomers and planetary scientists, 18 percent of women who 
        are members of racial or ethnic minority groups and 12 percent 
        of White women skipped professional events because they did not 
        feel safe attending.
            (3) Reporting procedures with respect to sexual harassment 
        are inconsistent among Federal research agencies and have 
        varying degrees of accessibility.
            (4) There is not adequate communication among Federal 
        research agencies and between such agencies and recipients 
        regarding reports of sexual harassment, which has resulted in 
        harassers receiving Federal funding after moving to a different 
        institution.
