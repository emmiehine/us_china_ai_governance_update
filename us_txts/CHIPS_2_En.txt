    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Near-Earth objects remain a threat to the United States.
            (2) Section 321(d)(1) of the National Aeronautics and Space 
        Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-155; 
        119 Stat. 2922; 51 U.S.C. 71101 note prec.), established a 
        requirement that the Administrator plan, develop, and implement 
        a Near-Earth Object Survey program to detect, track, catalogue, 
        and characterize the physical characteristics of near-Earth 
        objects equal to, or greater than, 140 meters in diameter in 
        order to assess the threat of such near-Earth objects to the 
        Earth, with the goal of 90 percent completion of the catalogue 
        of such near-Earth objects by December 30, 2020.
            (3) The goal described in paragraph (2) has not be met.
